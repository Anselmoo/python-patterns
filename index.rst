 Python Design Patterns
========================

by @\ `brandon_rhodes <https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes>`_

Welcome!

* Here I’m collecting my ideas about Python Design Patterns,
  to make them available in one place.

* My hope is that these pages make the patterns more discoverable —
  easier to find in web searches, and easier to read —
  than when they were scattered across the videos and slides
  of my `Python conference talks <http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/>`_.

* The weight of other obligations makes my progress intermittent.
  To check for new material,
  simply visit the commit history of this site’s
  `project repository on GitHub <https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/python-patterns>`_,
  where you can also select “Watch” to get updates.

With those preliminaries complete, here are the patterns!
